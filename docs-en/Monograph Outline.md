Monograph Outline: "Six-Dimensional Thinking "


Preface: Dance on the Balance Beam—A Pilgrimage Through the Thinking Spectrum
A Pilgrimage Through the Thinking Spectrum
The vastness of the human cognitive toolbox: from binary oppositions to systemic emergence.
The Thinker's Art of Balance
The core metaphor: A girl dancing on a balance beam.
"Balance" within "Tension": Between "linear" and "non-linear," "local" and "global."
"Colorful" "Fusion": The ability to switch and blend thinking modes based on context.
The Ascending Structure of This Book
